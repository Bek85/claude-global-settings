# Code Pattern Analogies

Analogies that map code concepts to everyday experiences.

## Control Flow

| Pattern | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| **if/else** | A fork in the road - you choose one path based on conditions |
| **switch/case** | A vending machine - press a button, get the corresponding item |
| **loop** | A factory assembly line - same operation repeated on each item |
| **recursion** | Russian nesting dolls - open one, find a smaller version inside |

## Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Analogy |
|---------|---------|

| **Singleton** | A country's president - only one instance exists at a time |
| **Factory** | A bakery - takes an order, produces the right type of bread |
| **Decorator** | Gift wrapping - adds features without changing the core item |
| **Adapter** | Power plug converter - makes incompatible interfaces work together |

## Data Structures

| Structure | Analogy |
|-----------|---------|
| **Array** | A row of mailboxes - numbered slots holding items |
| **Stack** | A stack of plates - last one placed is first one taken (LIFO) |
| **Queue** | A line at a coffee shop - first in, first served (FIFO) |
| **Hash Map** | A library catalog - look up by key, get the location instantly |
| **Tree** | Family tree - parent nodes with children branching out |

## Async Patterns

| Pattern | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| **Promise** | A restaurant buzzer - "I promise to notify you when your table is ready" |
| **async/await** | Waiting for a reply - pause here, continue when response arrives |
| **Callback** | "Call me back when you're done" - leave your number, get a call later |
| **Event Loop** | A waiter managing multiple tables - handles whoever needs attention next |

## State Management

| Pattern | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| **Immutability** | A photograph - you can't change it, only create new versions |
